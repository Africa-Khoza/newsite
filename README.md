New official Africa Khoza website. Inspired by Oklama.

Oklama ( https://oklama.com/ ) was a promotional website for Kendrick Lamar's 5th studio album "Mr Morale & The Big Steppers". It has a barebones / brutalist design style & provided fans with consistent updates around the album prior to it's eventual release.
